## How to run the code

## How to contribute

The `main` branch in this repository is protected. Changes can only be made to it through approved pull requests. To make contributions, follow the workflow detailed below:

1. Open a new branch **from `main`.** Each branch should implement a simple task, so branches are not open for too long. Give the branch a descriptive name, so that other contributors know which branch to look at for a particular task.
1. Commit to the branch related to the task you are working on until it is complete. If the task takes more than a week to complete, consider breaking it into two separate tasks and branches.
1. Once your task is completed, open a pull request to the `main` branch, request a review from another repo member and **notify the reviewer on Slack.**
1. The reviewer will:
    1. Read, comment and suggest modifications to the lines that were added or deleted.
    1. Run the code **for the entire project** to guarantee that the changes are not breaking any component of the project.
    1. Make note of any changes to the outputs to confirm that they are intentional.
    1. Notify the person who opened the pull request on Slack once the review is submitted.
1. If the reviewer approved all changes, he person who opened the pull request will **merge** and **delete** the feature branch. If the reviewer requested changes, the person who opened to pullrequest will respond to the reviewer's comments and address any requests, then notify the reviewer on Slack that his comments are addressed.
1. Points `4` and `5` will be repeated until all changes are approved.
