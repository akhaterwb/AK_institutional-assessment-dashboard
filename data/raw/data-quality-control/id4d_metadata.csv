ID.OWN.BRTH.ZS,CC BY-4.0,Birth certification (%),,The percentage of children under age 5 whose births were registered at the time of the survey and whose birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or caretaker says that a birth certificate has been issued for the child.,"UNICEF Global Databases, 2022",Identification,,Annual,Weighted average,"The primary source for data on birth certification are nationally representative household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). The DHS and MICS employ slightly different question structures for this topic, but both ask a caregiver to report whether a child has been registered and whether a birth certificate was issued for that child. This creates three categories of response: “birth registered, with a certificate”, “birth registered, no certificate”, and “birth not registered”. The DHS combines all three outcomes as responses for one question, whereas the MICS question is multi-step and also probes further by asking the respondent to show the birth certificate if they can (in an attempt to mitigate for confusion with other documents).","A birth certificate serves as a legal proof of identity for children and is an important document for securing their recognition before the law and safeguarding their rights. Without a birth certificate, children may be unable to access basic services, such as routine vaccines and healthcare.",The primary source for data on birth certification comes from nationally representative surveys. Research suggest that birth certification rates reported by survey respondents (typically the mother or other primary caregiver) may be higher that actual birth certification as respondents may confuse documents such as the birth notification form with a birth certificate.,https://data.unicef.org/,Completeness of birth registration (%) (SP.REG.BRTH.ZS),

Birth registration estimates are primarily drawn from nationally representative household surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Other data sources include other national surveys, censuses and vital statistics from civil registration systems, and estimated coverage of birth registration within national civil registration systems from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).","Society typically first acknowledges a child’s existence and identity through birth registration. The right to be recognized as a person before the law is a critical step in ensuring lifelong protection and is a prerequisite for exercising all other rights. A birth certificate, issued following birth registration, is an important identity document for children. Birth registration also serves a statistical purpose. Universal birth registration is an essential part of a system of vital statistics, which tracks the major milestones in a person’s life – from birth to marriage and death. Such data are essential for planning and implementing development policies and programs, particularly in health, education, housing, water and sanitation, employment, agriculture and industrial production. The proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority is the official indicator for SDG Target 16.9, which sets out to “By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration”.","Data on the prevalence of birth registration is collected mainly through censuses, civil registration systems (CRVS) and household surveys. Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births in a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given period. However, the systematic recording of births in many countries remains a serious challenge. In the absence of reliable administrative data, household surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth registration. In most low- and middle-income countries, such surveys represent the sole source of this information.

Substantial differences can exist between CRVS coverage and birth registration levels as captured by household surveys. The differences are primarily because data from CRVS typically refer to the percentage of all births that have been registered (often within a specific timeframe) whereas household surveys often represent the percentage of children under age five whose births are registered.
